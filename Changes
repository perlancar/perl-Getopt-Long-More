        [BUG FIXES]

	- Avoid hijacking GoL legacy default dests [GH#9]

	- Evaporate OptSpec if it has no handler; do not warn if unable to
          fulfill validation. [GH#5]

	- Try using Complete::Bash's format_completion() with
	  workaround_with_wordbreaks=0 (my use case: 'subsort by_several -A
	  first=asc^' completes to 'subsort by_several -A asciibetically _'
	  without this option).

        [TESTS]

	- Add tests for the case of optspec has required=1 or has default
	  but no handler is supplied (ref: PR#7).

	- Add more test cases, mostly related to "missing handler".


0.005   2019-01-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Handle "hash storage mode" of Getopt::Long (where GetOptions
          is called with a hashref as its first argument). Also fix
          compatibility with Getopt::Long which does not require explicit
          "linkage" (option handler), e.g. GetOptions('foo', 'bar', 'baz') is
          allowed by Getopt::Long. (Thanks Tabulon!) [GH#1] [GH#3]

        - Allow extra optspec properties x, x.*, _* to store comments or
          whatever [GH#2].
